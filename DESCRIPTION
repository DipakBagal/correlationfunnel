Description: 
    The 'correlationfunnel' package drastically speeds up Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    by providing a succinct workflow and interactive visualization tools for understanding
    which features have relationships to target (response). This is excellent for pre-modeling / 
    pre-Machine Learning since you can determine quickly if you have predictive features, 
    those with relationship to the target feature.
